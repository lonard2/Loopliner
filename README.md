## Why I made the game
In these days, public transportation should be a necessity as a way to improve society in my opinion. It positively contributes to the improvement of environment, solidarity, financial, and more, compared with personal transport. However, with the advent of technology, some people are tend to have more individualistic (at least in my observation). I personally believe that all public transportation users (whether it's train, buses, boats, planes, etc.) should be equipped with "smart" attributes that leverage the benefits of those systems. "Smart" in this terms are mainly about being always empathic & mastery on using the systems, as those could support everyone for making public transport better in many terms (such as safety, comfort, and service quality).\
If I learned from my observation, people are tend to follow engaging and fun stuffs instead of the boring ones, thus I'm have an idea to make people learn about the great ways (or the smart ways) to use public transportation. Then, Loopliner is born.

## About Loopliner
Hello, Loopliner! It is an public transportation-themed interactive experience game (some of you could tend to call this an visual novel due to half of the gameplay are in ADV/visual novel mode) that is set in my hometown, Jakarta, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©.\
In this game, you will play as Robert, a new commuter whom lived in North Jakarta that is just first riding the city's commuter train. He's excited to do the journey, with the expectations of him being understandable towards other passengers & knowledgeable to use the train system. The main goal is to guide him to Cisauk station, where the campus is located the nearest, with those expectations are fulfilled for his future commuting.

##
**- Simple, modern, and intuitive user experience design.** Not too complicated user experience, allowing for quick & easy usage experience.\
**- Review your commuting journey, before going into the real thing.** Via the interactive map which accessible from the main menu, you could check out the Jakarta's commuter train system in more detail. The feature is suitable for you whom wanted to learn about public transportation in a sense, even it could be possible to use as during travel to Jakarta.\
**- Accessible for many commuters.** I believe that public transportation should be universal & welcoming for everyone, thus I'm aiming to have Loopliner having many accessibility features. At first, it have colorblind mode (which takes effect on the map view & intermission view) and manual-crafted screen reader support.\
**- Act like a real commuter.** With some interactions & cues are mimicking the real-life commuting, you could learn or adapt how commuters doing. Activities you could do are payment (tap-in/tap-out), balance checking, select platforms & next trains, and deciding to stay/exit train.\
**- Decision is crucial.** Encounters or big events will occurs sometimes, and Robert should follow your choice. He will get successful, apathy, or bad outcomes, depending on how the choices done. Outside those, choices will appear too which mainly make the difference for Robert's journey.
